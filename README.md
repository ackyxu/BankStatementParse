# Bank Statment Parsers

I originally used these script (in a jupyter notebook) to parse PDF copies of client's bank statement into .csv files.

The .csv file format is a lot easier to work with when developing automation scripts with analyzing client's transactions for bank reconciliation and for importing transactions into various accounting softwares for the client.
